# Fix Training Pipeline Issues - Enum Consistency and Class Distribution

## 🎯 Overview
This PR fixes critical training pipeline issues that were causing "Number of classes does not match size of target_names" errors during model training and evaluation.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Enum Import Conflicts
- **Problem**: Different modules were importing `RiskLevel` and `ScenarioType` enums from different sources (`utils.constants` vs `attached_assets.safetyAppDataset_1755171350672`), causing dictionary lookup failures in risk level mapping.
- **Solution**: Standardized all modules to use enums from `utils.constants` for consistency.

### 2. Classification Report Errors
- **Problem**: `classification_report` was called with hardcoded class names for all 4 risk levels, but datasets might only contain a subset of classes, causing sklearn errors.
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic classification report generation that adapts to the actual classes present in the data.

### 3. Non-Stratified Data Splitting
- **Problem**: Random data splitting could result in train/validation/test sets missing some risk level classes, especially with small datasets.
- **Solution**: Added stratified splitting with automatic fallback to random splitting when stratification fails.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Core Fixes
- **`src/data_loader.py`**: Fixed enum imports to use consistent source
- **`src/evaluation.py`**: Added dynamic classification report generation
- **`app.py`**: Implemented stratified data splitting with error handling

### Documentation & Dependencies
- **`requirements.txt`**: Added comprehensive dependency list with version constraints
- **`README.md`**: Updated with v1.1 changelog, troubleshooting section, and improved installation instructions

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Verified enum consistency across all modules
- ✅ Tested training pipeline with various dataset sizes and class distributions
- ✅ Confirmed stratified splitting works with balanced and imbalanced datasets
- ✅ Validated dynamic classification reports adapt to available classes
- ✅ Tested fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## 🚀 Impact
- **Training Reliability**: No more enum-related crashes during training
- **Robust Evaluation**: Classification reports work regardless of class distribution
- **Better Data Handling**: Stratified splits ensure representative training/test sets
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages and automatic fallbacks
