## 📋 Overview
This PR adds a comprehensive `requirements.txt` file and improves the README documentation to make the project easier to install and use.

## 📁 Files Changed
- ✅ **`requirements.txt`** - New file with comprehensive dependency list
- ✅ **`README.md`** - Updated installation instructions and documentation

## 🔧 Changes Made

### New requirements.txt
- **Comprehensive dependency list** with proper version constraints
- **Organized by category** (Core ML, Web App, Visualization, etc.)
- **Version ranges** that ensure compatibility
- **Optional dependencies** clearly marked for development/testing
- **All dependencies needed** for the complete ML platform functionality

### README.md Improvements
- **Fixed installation instructions** with virtual environment setup
- **Corrected Streamlit port** from 5000 to 8501 (actual default)
- **Added system requirements** section with memory/storage needs
- **Included dependency explanations** for each major package
- **Installation tips** for different environments and package managers
- **Support for both pip and uv** package managers

## 📦 Dependencies Included

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Verified all dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Tested installation instructions on clean environment
- ✅ Confirmed Streamlit runs on port 8501
- ✅ Validated virtual environment setup works
- ✅ Checked both pip and uv installation methods

## 📋 Installation Test
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sensor-fusion-ml-platform

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
streamlit run app.py
# Should open on http://localhost:8501
```

## 🔄 Breaking Changes
None - This is purely additive documentation and dependency management.

## 📚 Additional Notes
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- New users will have much clearer setup instructions
- Dependency versions chosen for stability and compatibility
- Optional dependencies can be skipped for basic usage
